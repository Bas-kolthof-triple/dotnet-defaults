# Coding Guidelines

## C# General

In order to improve team wide readablity and lower onboarding time we agreed to stick to defined coding guidelines. These coding guidelines help us writing better and more coherent code, both on an individual level, as well as across individual developers since the style becomes more aligned.

The coding guidelines can be found [here](https://csharpcodingguidelines.com/).
